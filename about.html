                <h1>About</h1>
                <p> In a time filled with darkness and uncertainty, what we ask ourselves is: what can we do? How can we honor the lives of those who did not make it? How can we educate the masses about what's happening?
                    This is where PaliFest comes in. A three day festival where we celebrate and learn about Palestine and it's beautiful culture. Learn about Palestine and it's culture through live performances, spiritual readings, films, and more. </p>

                   <p> May 16th: Opening ceremony with a performance by MC Abdul. Also taking place is film showings, spiritual readings, and educational workshops</p>

                   <p> May 17th: Gift-making stations (i.e. Jewlery, Kiffeyehs, and more), test kitchens, and painting </p>

                   <P> May 18th: Final day: Live performances including dance, tragedies, and musical performances from headliners Aness and Macklemore. </P>

                   <p> Toyota Pavillion at Concord. Concord, CA</p>

                   <h1>DID YOU KNOW...?</h1>

                   <P> Watermelon has the same colors as the Flag of Palestine. It's also used as a symbol for Palestine. </P>

                   <p> How? </p> 

                   <p> Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel banned the display of the Palestinian flag and its colours in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with the Israeli army allegedly arresting anyone who displayed it. As a way of showing resilience and defiance, Palestinians began using Watermelons as an alternative to the Palestinian flag; each Watermelon slice has the same colors as the Palestinian flag. Since the current bombardment in Gaza that took place in October 2023, the watermelon symbol has experienced a resurgence in popularity. Individuals have been leveraging it, often using watermelon emojis (üçâ) on various social media platforms to show support for Palestine. </P>
